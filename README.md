## Features
This app enables the user to view past, present, and future events. The application will dynamically update throughout the day. It indicates passed time by graying out the relevant section. The present moment is displayed in red to remind you to focus and complete current tasks. The future is presented in green, encouraging you to keep going. Users can update the application to display what has actually happened throughout the day. This is achieved by saving the input into local storage.
